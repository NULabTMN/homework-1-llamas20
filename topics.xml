	<text>Saxophone Wail, Jazz
Make Indians Wild
Again, Says Pastor
Philadelphia, Jan. 21.—Modern
jazz music and dancing are making
the Indians wild again. The roll of
the snare drum and the wail of the
saxophone, combined with the "tod
dle" and the "shimmy" stir atavistic
memories of the tom-tom and the
shriek of the victim at the stake.
So asserted Dr. Henry Beets of
Grand Rapids, Mich., secretary of
missions of the Christian Reformed
church, in an address Friday before
the session of the Friends of the
Indian.
A resolution he introduced seek
ing to forbid Indian youths and girls
from dancing the modern steps, was
adopted and will be sent to the In
dian bureau of the department of
the interior at Washington.</text>

	<text>JAZZ," that root of much
evil in music, a menace to
established rythmical law
and order and beauty and
grace, is dying its slow but natural
death
Syncopation which tends ^toward
"shimmying," wriggling and hop?
ping about dance floors as in the
days cf prehistoric barbarism is dis?
appearing and, according to those
authorities who make it their busi?
ness to study dancing, the demise of
"jazz" occasions more general joy
than sorrow. Puritanical grand?
mothers and perhaps less prudish
fathers and mothers who attend and
chaperon social dances of the young
need not much longer blush when
their eyes sweep the ballroom. The
youth of the nation may, after all,
grow up amidst less sensuous music
and dancing positions which em?
barrass their elders. A reaction
against this sort of thing is in full
swing in the United States and, like
a burned out plague, "jazz" music
and "jazz" dancing are leaving us.
While "jazz"' still retains its ad?
mirers and supporters, its own
ridiculousness has done more toward
it? eliminatii n than any other agen?
cy, believes Fenton T. Bott, presi?
dent of the American National As?
sociation, Masters of Dancing, who
is now in New York to attend the
thirty- annual convention of
that association, beginning August
25, at the Hotel Astor.
For Clean Dancing
The association, with it? more
than five hundred active members in
every city cf any r-ize in the UYiited
States and Canada, has been one of
the agencies working quietly since
the advent of "jazz" to keep danc?
ing clean and moral. In coopera?
tion with many civic and welfare so?
cieties throughout the country, much
has been done to eliminate the sala
ciou: and immoral features which
this form of syncopation brought
he dance floor.
"We do not recognize the terrr
'jazz,' which is purely a coined
word," Mr. Bot; told The Tribune
"We ever, recognize synco
d.we have nothing agai?.si
of syncopated music.
It can be playi i so brilliantly if
played right, and then again it can
ther form so sensu?
ous and evil that it harks clear back
to the wild and irresponsible barba?
rism of the dark ages. We have
tried and preach modera?

copation, tins so-called 'jazz,' whicr
during tne more unrestrained perioc
of the war swept the country witl
a crop of immodesty in both son?
and dance in its wake. It first ap
peared on the stage, and eventually
it audaciously entered the publi;
dance hail and private ballroon
alike.
"There is a decided upward tren?
in music now, as compared with i
year ago," continued the dance mas
ter president. "New York, a leade
in entertainment whose example i
followed everywhere, is setting
cleaner pace. Compare New York'
roof gardens of some of the leadin?
hotels, compare the theaters, th

"To-day we find 'jazz' dying

There has been virtually no op?
position to the anti-jazz campaign
waged by his organization except
from a few unscrupulous dance hall
proprietors, said the president.
"Dancing is an essential," he
added. "What would tens of thou?
sands of people do nightly in New
York if they were not permitted to
go somewhere, meet socially, and
dance? If the places where these
people meet are decent there can be
no finer, more healthful or enjoy?
able recreation anywhere."
"What do you consider good or
bad positions in dancing?" he was
asked.
"It is difficult to illustrate posi?
tions," he answered. "Anyone can
see with a glance over the dance
floor wdiether positions are good or
bad. When you take hold of a girl
to dance, common sense and decency
should prompt your position. If your
attitude toward her is proper, you
will not crush your body against
hers nor place your cheek against
hers.</text>

The Torment of Imbeciles
"Jazz, for example, I think, was invented
by imps for the torment of imbeciles. True,
it does not contain any distinct immoral
teaching, because music is not a didactic
art, but jazz does contain a real immoral
influence, because it confuses, bewilders, be
numbs and befuddles the mind through the
ears. It Is, in effect, the dope or knockout
drop In the art of sound,
"Laws against immoral art? Yes. I sup

It necessary to have something of that kind,
otherwise we should have cartloads of filth

but these laws, it should be remembered, are
very imperfect in their scope and uncertain
in their application. They can do a little
to help I's, but not very much. To rely
upon legislation as a safeguard against
immorality in art?that is, as a real safe
guard?Is a great mistake. The true de

Immoral Dances; Jazz Craze Must Go
Appeal Made to Musicians to
Chaperones Included in Warning.
Th danolng that ha been Indulged
In at some of the public dancing hall
In Chattanooga haa been the subject
of much comment lately. Orchestra
leader are beginning to think that
unless they feature that "Jazs Blues"
they will not be popular. The young
girl who attend these dance, ac
cording to those who are best In
formed are beginning to feel the same
way. In other word, the danolng
publlo ha gone "Jazx mad."
The first step to take In order to
reform the publlo dancing hall," ac
cording to Al Wilson, of the Wilson
Dancing achool, "1 to have strict
rule in these publlo places, and to
have some one there to see that they
are enforced." Mr. Wilson states
that while the average person dances
for the love of dancing, on the other
hand there are some who dance only
for the opportunity of coming In
close contact with those of the op
posite sex. For thin reason, Mr. Wll
on ayi, the hugging and cheek-to-cheek
dancing must go. He says
that the time ha come when the
people must take a stand against all
!:lnd of (Immoral dancing. He
print out that the lover of dancing
do not necessarily have to go back
to th ancient dancing, for the mod
ern dances, If danced properly, are far
more attractive and graceful. He
state that even "the )nzz" fox trot
with the tickle-toe can be danced In
a moral way. But unfortunately the
average young couple, he adds, danc
ing the fox trot, very closely resemble
Jclly-ln-a-bowl on a frosty morning.
The dancing- master continued "Some
of our best girls dance this way be
cause they think It la 'stylish.' They
mean absolutely no harm, but think
to be popular they must rub all the
skin oft the left side of their face
against the wiry beard of some young
man. How some people can dance
all hugged up I past me; fact Is,
they don't dance, they Just hop.
Notice a couple of real dancer on
exhibition, and you will see at least
four Inches of space between them.
That Is the real comfortable way to
dance. You must be educated In
proper dancing." x
Warming to hi subject, Mr. Wil
son says: "We appeal to mothers
and chaperones to help us elevate
dancing. We also appeal to musi
cians. They do not realize how much
help they can be. The way Is to cut
out so much "Jazz" and play the

	<text>'rag iime' of the negroes of America, too.
Wtiai is more, it is music thai I will defy
any composer or music-writer in America
to take down properly, unless he makes a
special study of it."
It seemed very easy. There was the
rhythmic swing and the odd cadence
common to all negro singing.
"It has a charm of its own," said H. M.
Bosworth, our noted local organist and
composer, as he listened to the exposition
of a music that was new to him, though
be had spent his life as a student of St.
Cecilia's art. "Its charm is peculiar—
the charm of a suggested savagery. The
music carries with it the picture of the
negro's half-shuffle, the accentuated walk
that accompanies liin singing."
"There is the wnole secret of rag time,"
Mr. Whiting asserted. "The negro strikes
the keys of the piano in the same time
and measure as he taps the floor with his
heels in dancing or 'pats juba. 1 This results
in a peculiar movement that interested
me because it evaded me, and later because
I found that no white man had ever writ
ten it, though many had tried.
"It was down Mobile way that I was
first interested in rag: time," Mr. Whiting
explained. "1 bad played the first move
ment ol Mendels-ohn's 'Weduing March'
for a big 'buck nigger' one of the burly
water-front roustabouts, barefooted and
with shirt open to the belt that fastened
his rauged trousers above his hips. He
had the hoarse, foghorn voice that still
was full of music ihe voice you can find
only in this class or negro— and it was said
be could play anything lie ever heard.
'Ya-as, sir, I kin play it,' he drawled.
'But it seems toe me it's jes' a beat too
fas', mistali.'
"Then he asked me to play it again. I did
so. That negro then sat down. He had
absorbed Mendelsohn's idea, digested it,
and when it was produced it came in rag
time, this way":
Here Mr. Whitney played a bit of music
It had the soul of "Darkest Africa." in it,
with a reminiscence of the modern. Know
ing what it was, the musical auditor could
Jo. low and detect the motif of the great
German composer disguised in its Ethi
opian garb.
"I tried to play that march as my negro
collaborator did and failed. I had him
play it aerain. Again I attempted it, to
nnd that I had beinte me a musical puzzle.
"As I had received a good musical edu
cation, my interest was aroused. 1 set to
work for a solution.
"Again and aeain I had the negro play
his march. There was tho repetition of
several movements that seemed very sim
ple. But they were as elusive as they were
simple.
I? was evident that the effect was ob
tained by syncopation, but I could not es
tablish jus>t where it occurred. For sev
eral days I studied with my colored ac
quaintance and then light came.
"The movement was not completed in
one measure as in the music of the Cau
casian. It took two bars of rap time to
complete one movement. The syncopa
tion begins in the latter pan of the first
bar and continues into the second meas
ure. The odd part is that not only is the
time B\-ncor>aied, but the accent is synco
pated also, being purposely misplaced and
thus giving a striking individuality to ihe
negro melody.
"Once interested I bepan to look into the
matter of 'rag time' in earnest. I found
it wherever there were negroes. They are
natural-born imitators, as well as :iatural
born musicians.</text>

	<text>BAN ON RAGTIME MUSIC.
Dancing Masters Propose to Banish
It Prom the Best Ball Rooms.
Chicago Chronicle.
The American Socicly of Professors of
Dancing was in annual session at Sara
toga recently. The American Society of
Dancing is called into session every year
to dictate the ball room proprieties for
the coining season. The first action to be
taken by the professors assembled at
Saratoga was one of disapproval against
rag-time music and rag-time dancing.
The dancing teachers entered their pro
test to the popular music of this coun
try on the argument that it is too jerky
and lacks the grace necessary for dance
music. The hopping which is now done
in the ballroom is, they say, not at all
in keeping with good taste. There are
none of the graceful, easy motions of
the waltz, none of the gliding, sweeping
motions of the old two-Eteps in the popu
lar dance step of today. In plain, the
dancing masters have said there can bo
no graceful dancing with rag-time, and
to righten this evil they have set them
selves to the task of retiring rag-time
music from the ballroom. Just what
they will put in its place they have not
determined, or at least have not an
nounced.
It is enough that they will do away
with the rag-time, the music which has
held the vaudeville dancers and the vau
deville audiences and the public in gen
eral in its clutches for ever so long. It
is hard to remember when there was no
rag-time music to be whistled by all the
newsboys and to run in every one's
mind. It is hard to remember when any
one danced anything more elaborate than
a two-step. The rag-time has possessed
the American people during these past
two years, they "have been completely be
witched by it, music without the rag
time twist has been allowed a hearing.
There has been ragtime at the circus,
rag-time at all the dances of society,
rag-time for the hymns at many Sunday
schools.
It was the Salvation Army that first
grasped the situation and introduced rag
time into the hymns for the street corner
services. That was six years ago. Since
then singing evangelists have adopted it
largely in their revival work, it has been
crowded into the Sunday school yong
book to hold the attention of the pupils,
it has been the fad for camp-meetings,
it has even been used in n-any of the
churches. There is no honor for music
with which it has not been dignified. If
has been played in the same programme
with the music of the masters, it has
even taken the place of the masterpieces
at musicales.</text>

Minneapolis, Minn. —Ragtime music

“I have learned,’.’ said Mr. Baldwin,
“that ragtime music or the singing of

Alexander of the El Paso public school.
'I do not mean this as an epigram or a

fact. What is syncopated time, but
the establishment of an unbalanced
rhythm. Instead of the mind gain
ing what it naturally expects
there is a broken tempo which

quite as much a stimulant of the nerves

Music of a regular tempo calls for a

this is a little too soon to discuss the
effect of music upon public morals,

admitted music is one of the arts that
escapes a positive definition. Its ef

violence, it is by music and rhythm
that armies move on to battle. It Is by
music that the negro worked the best

veloped a marvelous national music of
somber coloring because of the sadness
and melancholy of their lives. Who
can say what part music has not played
in the development of the Teutonic
people. It is a field we know too little
about. The best proof of the destruc
tiveness of ragtime upon the moral na
ture is open for debate in any dance
hall in America."
"It Is the more cultured class of

a .similar campaign here.
The local Y M. A. has not f onflld

In fact, it was stated today by a di

Mrs, Jack Slaton’s Views.
Mr’s. John M. Slaton, wife of the
governor-elect of Georgia, president of
the Atlanta Muslc.il association, con
fessed that she lik» ragtime as a girl,
and had never found cause to denounce
it. even as the first -lady-to-be of the
state.
Mrs. Siatoit said tha; lie, favor for
“a little ragtime now and then’* had
continued to grow, despite th* fact that
the musical association, of which she
is pH*si< ti 1 has its its chief purpose

musical rnlerit.
As to th- moral effect ragtime has on
tlje youth and society of Atlanta, Mrs.
Slaton sahl that she was unable to tell,
not having studied the question suffi
ciently.
Mrs. John K. ttley, of 20 Ponce De
Leon avenue, an authority on music
and things musical, declined to express
an opinion on the subject.
Mrs. Ottley said she had mve given
consideration to the possibb- bipl
fe«-t of the averag. ragtime song on
Atlanta soci«*ty and Its morals. At
hast, she said, she had no specific
as'-s of injury to it
Calls Ragtime a Disease.
“Ragtime music Is n disease. It
spreads rapidly, and With dire result J
to our youth, who lose through It the
sense of appreciation of classical mu
sic. the real music.”
Thus tile subject is regarded by' Dr.
Percy J. Starnes, the municipal organ
ist and the organist for tin IHfth regi
ment at tlie Auditor ium.
Dr. Starnes is heartily in favo of
placing a ban on ragtime, and In- would
start by having a prohibitive city ordi
nance against certain flongs and cer-
tain compositions of dance music. H--

	<text>Two Roosevelt Bears had a home out West
In a big ravine near a mountain crest,
Where they ate their meals and took their rest,
And gathered sunshine and strength and cheer,
And welcomed friends from far and near.
They chopped down trees and hunters dared,
And bossed ttieir ranch and panthers scared,
And preached to goats and bighorn sheep,
And ordered that they the laws should keep.
They boxed with chums and umpired strife,
And generally led a strenuous life.
One bear was black and one was gray
Each was good and neither would say
A swear word loud either night or day.
In love and learning they were both alike,
They could run a motor or hike a bike,
Or drive a hansom as good as Mike,
Or sit at dinner with the smartest set,
Or talk in a phone or dance or bet,
Or send wireless messages from tree to tree,
Or copy the styles like you and me.
These things they had learned from papers lost
By weary travelers as the hills they crossed.
They did things fair and neither would bite
If deals were square and white was white
And neighbors tried to do things right.
They lived for fun and not for fame,
And if fame it came it was just^the same.
They were honest bearsrfrom nose to paw
They kept out of debt and obeyed the law.
The black bear's name was TEDDY-B
The for black or brown, you see,
Or bright or bold or brave or boss
He was always kind and seldom cross.
The gray bear's name was TEDDY-G
The for grizzly or gray, for he
Was as full of fun as a bear can be.
Not for bad and for good
The black bear wanted it understood.
The "Teddy" part is a name they found
On hat and tree and leggings round,
On belt and boot, and plates of tin,
And scraps of paper and biscuits thin,
And other things that hunters drop
When they chase a bear to a mountain top.
Their home was high and deep and wide,
An elegant place for bears to hide
The things picked up on the mountain side.
A"
"With bags on backs and sticks in hand they started their tramp across the land."
They were well supplied with hats and boots,
And leather coats and cowboy suits,
And pots and pans and whips and strings,
And guns and horns and a hundred things
Lost on the trail by hunters bold
When driven home by the winter's eold.
The bears were tired of the life they led
They wanted to see the world, they said
To visit New York and Boston, too
And perhaps Chicago and Kalamazoo
To go to theater and church and school,
To see a banker or broker, and fool
With money a little and try a hand
At running a paper or leading a band.
1
They bad heard of things bears never see:
Golf and weddings and afternoon tea
Trolleys and trains and buildings high,
And machines that write and machines that fly,
And hotels with waiters clear out of range,
And bulls and bears in a stock exchange,
And players who work for life and death
To punch a ball clean out of breath
And millionaires smart and robbers bold
Who play with wagonloads of gold
And folks high up in the social set,
Who walk on air and have Btyle to let
And Tammany Hall, where a tiger rules,
And the G. O. P. and its financial schools,
And the President and his eldest Bon,
And the Capitol at Washington
And other things both great and small
That bears have never seen at all.
The news had scattered far and wide
That the bears would leave the mountain side,
Give away their goods and rent their trees,
And travel East and beyond the seas.
Their friends had gathered to laugh and sigh,
35? !&**"
you come with us don't touch your gun don't make a fuss."
To give advice, and to fay good-by.
A wild mustang was the first to arrive)
The card said six, but he came at five.
An old bobcat with a bandaged knee
And a young cougar and red squirrels three
Came jumping in from tree to tree.
A panther bold and a gray coyote
Came up the creek in a hunter's boat
Two bighorn sheep and a mountain deer
Climbed down on ladders from cliffs quite near
And a score or more of friends in need
Came in with baskets and to get a feed.
Of eagles' wings and chipmunks' feet
With honey sauce that you couldn't beat
And a salad dish made of hemlock cones
And fishes' tails without the bones
A keg of milk shake with double tap
And a Boman punch made of cedar sap
Ten heads of cabbage to be eaten raw,
And a roasted pig stuffed with lion's paw,
On the biggest platter that ytfu ever saw
And bags of nuts, about a ton,
Supplied by squirrels for the evening fun.
The lunch was thru and the play was on
When a shot was heard from a hunter's gun.
The guests were ordered to run and hide
While the bears stepped out on the mountain tide.
A pistol was pointed by TEDDY-B
At a hunter who stood beside a tree.
"Hands up," he said, "you come with us
Don't touch your gun don't make a fuss."
The hunter was scared from head to toe,
He had dropped his gun and he had to go.
A lasso was thrown by TEDDY-G
And he caught his hunter about the knee
And tripped him up so that he couldn't see.
They marched them both to their home nearby,
And fed them on snails and pigeon pie
And toasted toads served with onion sauce,
And chipmunk skins stuffed with mountain mott
And a peck of scraps both cold and hot^
And all the soup left in the pot.
It made the bobcat laugh and the hunters frown,
But the bears stood by till all was down.
After the hunters were introduced around!
To all the guests upon the ground
They were made to sign in red and white
A bond the bears prepared that night
On birchbark paper and sealed in gold,
Which read like this in writing bold:
"We hereby take oath on bended knee
That from this hour on we do agree
To keep the peace and hunting stop
From canyon deep to mountain top
In weather fair, in snow or rain,
We'll never enter the bears' domain,
Or throw a stone or shoot again
At goat or game, at bird or beast,
Till the bears return from their journey East,"
The paper signed the law to keep
The guests lay down to have a sleep.
The hunters were rolled in a blanket wide
And swung like a hammock from .ide to sid*
Until both were snoring and satisfied.
i

"1
At break of day the hungers went
They left their guns and they left their tentj 1
They left a note which read, they say, 1
Like this: "Dear Bears, w are off, good day.
We like your home, but we wouldn't stay
For game or gold, for pie or pay
We are off for good we won't come back
We never again will cross your track
Till nights are white and days are black.
We hate your dinners, we love your pluck I
Good-by, old bears, good day, good luck."
The sun rose up in a cloudless sky
The bears were ready, they said good-by
To friends and trees and stones and hills,
And with money enough to pay their bills,
And bags on backs and sticks in hand
They started their tramp across the land.</text>

	<text>THE TEDDY BEAR
CRAZE IN NEW YORK
OVER in Germany there is a llttl*
old woman commanding: a com
pany of more than two thousand
workers whose busy fingers fly
from early morning till late at
night cutting out, stitching: up and put
ting together plush bears for the Amer
ican market. The New York people,
(rownups as well as children, have ap
parently pone crazy over these bears,
and they will not be satisfied with any
but those made by the German frau.
Years and years ago tUis woman de
6igned a pattern for a bear which was
so natural and appealed so to young
sters that she was culled the mother of
the bears. Then she had a tiny shop
in her house and only a few girls to
help her. That was before the bear
fad struck America. Now she has a
factory that covers a whole square and
the machinery and employes are work
ed week in and week out at high
pressure because Young America must
have his bears. As the orders pile in
with every mail and tables arrive
almost hourly the little old frau and
her workers hold up their two thousand
pairs of hands in consternation and
wonder if every man, woman and child
In America is sending for a whole fam
ily of bears.
They are not far wrong. The entire
country is in the clutches, or rather the
embrace, of the plush bear. .Even pot
dogs and dolls have had to step down
end out. His Majesty Bruin now reign;.
The bear rage started at the summer
resorts along the Jersey shore— some
say it was at Atlantic City. NAt any
rate, a nice, fat. winsome little brown
bear sitting on a counter in a board
walk shop attracted the eyes of a
youngster, and nothing would do but
mamma must stop and look at the
lovely plush animal. Mamma liked, the
bear, too. He was an excellent pocket
edition of those big cinnamon bears
•way up In Bronx Park, and the young
eter remembered the fun he had had
one day watching the bears lumber
around the sides -of the big iron in
closed pit and give each other love pats
with their huge paws. He would have
ft bear pit. too. Only this little plush
bear looked so clean that it would be
a shame to get him all dirty and
frowsy. The youngster took hold of the
coveted plaything and his delight grew.
Bruin had such a realistic little hump
at the back of his netk. and, bully! he
had a voice and his legs moved.
They were jointed and his solemn lit
tle pointed head would turn any way
you wanted it to, and the soles of his
feet, really the bottoms of his paw*,
were all soft and fiat and velvety, and
he had such dear little .rars and beady
black eyes. And the youngster remem
bered that the Bronx bears had mouths
exactly like this one, and even the ex
pression of Ms face was like the best
behaved and finest looking hear at the
park. Mamma must buy^uln for him.
He begged her to. and after a little con
versation with the shopkeeper over the
price, for the bear was rather an ex
pensive plaything, she finally paid
it end the wistful and anxious eyes
of her small son and heir fairly beam
ed with Joy as he^marched away hug
ging his prize, just as proudly as a
man or the President of the
United States returning from a suc
cessful hunt.
Bears Were Everywhere.
That started the bear fad. Of course,
every other little boy on the boardwalk
had to have a bear. It was Just the
thing for a boy. Girls had dolls to play
with and boys ought to have something
like a bear when it was too hot for
baseball or to play Indian in the park
or shipwrecked sailors ion the sand.
They gifcw eloquent in convincing their
mothers of their needs. And the man
in the shop found his bear stock totally
unequal to the sudden demands made
upon it. Inside of a few hours every
bear in the chop had been sold, tiny
ones and big ones, for they come in
several sizes, from the length of your
hand to the size of a well-grown
youngster.' So the shopkeeper tele
graphed to. New York, for more, and
these, too, went "like hot - cakes." - No
sooner were the plush figures put fn
the window than the shop was swarm
ing wltn ladles'after bears.
then other shops , stocked up with
them, and the big ones In New York
found themselves overwhelmed with
orders for Teddy bears. By this time
Young America had christened them,
appropriately, too. Isn't the President
the hero of eyery boy who longs to
grow big, enough to hold-, a gun to
shoot bears and some day do just the
very same things that "Teddy"' Roose
velt does? So""Teddy the bears were
named, and as Teddy they are known
now the length and breadth of V our
country, as well' as on the other side of
the Atlantic. ,"V
Never In the history of Wall street
was the country more at the mercy 'of
bears than it is today.; Stuffed plush
Teddies are fairly rampant, and Indl
cations show prospects of a long and
continued reign. Toy stores are pro
viding a dozen bears to one doll;* In
anticipation of the Christmas trade.
Department stores are stocking up with
them, and little out of the way shops
have^them for awhile, but not for long-, :
because as soon as ths-' youthful hunt
ers get on their track* they ; swoop
down and bring them to bay. '
The mother of the bears, the little
German frau, Is almost at her, v/its' end
to know what she is going todo, T*hcre
is a fear that the supply of brown" and
white plush v/Hl give out. and then
what would she do, for they wouldn't
be bears If they were made okany
other color. Onfl New York store, the
largest? has already sold over .sixty
thousand Teddies, and by every steamer
it gels hundreds of dozens, v.hieh are :
bought up at once.
Clothes t for the Bear, , ;
But boys are not the only lovrri of
i Teddy beam. By. no mean*.. Their lit
tle sifters like them, too. At first little
girls looked at the. new playthings with,
some trepidation. .Bears and dolls ar«s
so very different. Dolls; are "always
ladylike In their 'manners, but there Is
no counting on the actions of bears.
But closer examination proved that
they weren't so different after ail. Thyy
were Jointed just like dolls, and their
bodies were plump and round, and. they -
had such dear, quaint little faces. And,
wonder of wonders, no,. two really
looked exactly alike! . They may have
all been cut after the same pattern, but
there was a different' expression In the
eyes and mouth and the whole face. In
fact, of -each Teddy. .Instantly tho baby
sister decided she Jlked bear?, too,' and
Olivia May, "with, all her gorgeous (silk
and lace frocks and her. fetching ban
nets, was left lying on her face in the
corner of the nursery while the little
mother transferred her affection-, to
Teddy. , ._ •
However, the changeable young
mother soon found that she could; not,
count on being able to borrow Teddy
from her brother, so with the; wisdom
of her rex she decided that" the'only
thing to do was to. have one allfor.her.
very own. And mamma's purse ; "was
drawn on' for^ more Teddy bears. Then;
when the little sist«r got her.' new toy,
she was undecided- whether to choese a
brown , or a white • bear. ' She \u25a0 f elt • lost,

Habitues of Cehtral^Park asked them
selves this question, the other day
when they "were confronted by the
sight of a pretty, young woman, dressed
in the height' of fashion = and speeding
along. with » the utmost unconcern. She
was driving her • Columbia electric yic

She -, instantly became the mark for

the »lght -was a novelty was— has
Teddy bear now usurped the place of
the pet poodle as well as the doll?
There he sat. resting one front paw
against the side of the victoria and
-nestling close to ths warm motor coat
of his mistress, while his beady eyes
gazed straight ahead unflinchingly and
.without 'any, unduo pride. From time
to time the girl bent forward to see
how he was enjoying the drlvd, and
she gave 'him an affectionate pat now
and then ea she spoke to him in a
gentle voice. Some thought the bear
might have belonged to a small broth
er or sister, but they ,were soon con
vinced of the realnes* of * ' the fad
among: older people when, within a.
quarter of. an hour, another automobile
whizzed by with a Teddy bear occupy
ing the seat In the tonneau heretofore
held sacred to His Highness the pet
dog. .There was no denying the exist
ence of the fad in dead earnest.
Summer visitors in a, certain Paris
hotel were accustomed to seeing one
or" two particularly beautiful French
women come down to the restaurant
with Teddy bear companions, who wer*
placed by the sides 'of the ladles."
while, the erstwhile favorite bat-eared
French' dog was nursing his feelings
all alone upstairs. His poor little nose
— what there is of It — ia quite out of
Joint, and he is wondering how . long
his ridiculous rival will reign. There
are no more pleasant walks In the park
with his beautiful mistress. "When she
goes now she takes alonsr Teddy,
whether she is joined by the children
or not. .
"The next thinjr. I suppose, we will
be hearing of Teddy boar bench
\u25a0hows, and every woman will be trying
to buy blue ribbon bears, with pedl-
Krees its long as your arm." said a man
who had seen no less than half a scor<»
of pretty girls either drlvlns: or walk
ing with their bear pets. "Well. I won

THE "TEDDY-BEAR" FAD
His eyes never wink as they look into
hers,
She hugs him, and lugs him, and yet
he ne'er stirs
His luck he can't know, for he's lacking
in sense,
Yet "Teddy" is cuddled at some man's
expense.
His heart is but sawdust, his brain is
stuffed hair,
But all t}ie girls worship the dear
"Teddy-Bear."
The "Teddy-Bear" fad has struck
Minneapolis!
It has not as vet reached the ridicu
lous extremes attained in the east, vet
it is progressing in a very healthy
maniier.
Tne Teddy-Bear, as a child's play
thing, arrived some time ago. For sev
eral months he has been increasing in
numbers and bringing proportionately
greater joy to baby hearts, and more
numerous smiles to chubby, infant
faces
But the Teddy Bear as a fad, is a new
arrival. The fad seems to be spread
ing to beat mumps in a country school
The susceptible ones are voung women
of the "in society" class
A "dear girl's" first symptom of
contagion is a half-interested, half
ridiculmg admiration of the actions of
some chum who is far gone, and con
stantly hugging, loving, and lnggmg, a
Teddy-Bear. Gradually the infected
one's feeling of ridicule dies out the
interest changes to first a desire, then
a longing for a soft, sweet Teddy-Bear,
all her own.</text>

	<text>The Teddy bear is to be drnmatlied.
Harry Askln, manager of Ezra Kendall,
who Is now at the. Mason, is the man
who first sny the dramatic possibilities
of the little faddy toys, and astute ob
servers of things theatrical say that Mr.
Askln probably has hit upon a gold
mine. Of course some gold mines don't
pay dividends, bu"t this one Askln is
confident will nqt prove that kind of a
mine. ¦
His Idea is to turn the Teddy bears
Into a big extravaganza, which shall fol
low along the path blazed by "The Wiz
ard of Oz" and "Babes in Toyland."
ffhere will he brilliant ballets, surpris
ing stage effects and the usual extrava
ganaa riot of color and light.
As a matter of course an attempt w.lll
be made to appeal particularly to chil
dren, though grown-up boys and girls
also will tlnd much in the production de
signed for their pleasuring.
So far as is feasible the extravaganza
will be a dramatization of verses and
pictures whleh have run in "Judge" re
cently and which are said to have put
that publication again upon its feet at
a time when itß future seemed dubious.
The series .now has been published In
book form by the Reilly & Britton com
pany of Chicago, from whom Mr. Askin
secured the dramatic rights.
The verses relate the surprising ad
ventures of "Little Johnnie" and his six
Teddy bears, beginning with the discov
ery by Johnny's father of
"A truly wonderful compound.
With thin." hu cried, "I bellero I could
Pu'. life Into a stlrk of wood."
He rushes from the room to tell of his
great discovery and little Johnnie med
dles.
"He Rave his Teddy hrnrs six sips.
Tou should hnvi- aeon the little r'ps!
They bounced six foot up in tho air,
As lively as p real llvo hear."
With this explanation tho exploits of
Johnnie and his Teddy bears begin. Mis
chievous pranks follow each other In
rapid succession until Johnnie takes his
pets to a circus. They had no money,
but they got in all the same, as the
verses tell:
"Now hoys nnd Klrls. just use your eyes
And you will rpl h great surprise;
For John's made up his mind to go
And tnkc hl» Teddies to the show.
Johnnln holds up a piece of bread.</text>

	<text>Of course the Teddy l>ear felt lonesome
when Mr. Roosevelt went back 'home.
Ever since he came here 011 the pen
and ink limited, from those cozy Ixmisiana
canebrakes, years and years ago, he
had been at home around the White
House. Yessiree, the Teddy bear and Mr.
Roosevelt were great friends and
chummed together a whole lot of the
time. Of course, the bear sometimes disagreed
with things that Mr. Roosevelt
did. But he never quit to follow any
other trail. He just sat around the White
House?sometimes out in the yard; when
it was stormy inside?and looked sad and
sorrowful and reproachful and occasionally?but
not very often?really, truly
cross. But most of the time he was smiling
or laughing; and peeping under Mr. Roosevelt's
elbow or over his shoulder?he's a
curious little chap?or playing some sort of
a prank or other. And the Teddy bear, together
with oceans of other folks, thought
It was going to last forever.
But it didn't. And one day Mr. Roosevelt
packed up his things and said goodbye
to everybody and went back home.
Of course, he said good-bye to the Teddy
bear, too, and humpled his warm fur and
patted his little round head and pulled
his ears and tried not to notice that the
Teddy bear was winking and blinking
and swallowing as hard as could be?
Ai'prv nnur anH fh^in
Felt Lonesome at First.
Well, after Mr. Roosevelt had left, the
White House seemed mighty deserted to
the Teddy bear. There wasn't anv noise
and not a bit of excitement, and there
was nobody to chop down trees or walk
in the rain a hundred miles to play
tennis all afternoon. And the Teddy
bear, Just as folks will do sometimes,
got It Into his head that nobody
cared anything1 for him any
more. Besides, he had heard that Mr.
Taft, who was coming to live in the
White House In place of his old chum,
Mr. Roosevelt had a pet of his own, a
poesum, Well, that made the Teddy bear
)jr>od and cross, you can believe. Why,
9>wn where he came from no self-respecting
bear would1 speak to a possum on
the street, much less consort with one.
Not that there is anything so dreadful
about a possum, 'cept that some of the
collateral branches or" the family are not
looked up to, and that they are so melancholy.
A possum would rather hang
around a graveyard and read the inscriptions
on the stones and think of how
nice the world would be if it wasn't the
way it is.
Now, a Teddy bear hasn't any patience
with notions like that. And when he
heard that Mr. Taft's pet was a possum
he just figured that he'd better pack his
little grip and take the pen and ink limited
again back to the silence and oblivion
of the cane brakes. But he just
couldn't make up his mind, and one day
lie hid so that not even Mr. Berryman,
who knows him better than anybody
else, even Mr. Roosevelt, could find him.
Friends Start a Rumpus.
But the bear had more friends than he
thought?but the trouble was he didn't
stop to think. And the day after his disappearance
there were a whole lot of
people asking about him. And down at
The Star, where the Teddy bear lives
when he's not at the White House, about,
a million questions came in by mail. For
Instance, here s one from a "constant
reader," who says, "Did our ex-President
carry off little Teddy B., with him?
If so, please see to it that he sends him
back before he starts on his African trip,
for we in Washington cannot set on
without him, and, moreover, he belongs
to Uncle Sam, and I am sure our new
President will not be able to hold out
without him. We all miss his familiar
face and form so much, so please Insist
upon his return."
Now that made Teddy Bear feel a tiny
bit better, particularly as "constant reader's"
first name is Flora and she lives at
2014 2d street northwest. Then there
came another from a friend of the bear's
at 021 O street northwest, saving, "i ve
heard that you"?this was to the editor?
"are going to kill off the Teddy bear.
Please don't. We have an affection for
him. Uet Mr. Berryman keep him alive."
The Poets Get Busy.
And then came a mighty nice remembrance
from Jeannle Gillespie Pennington,
who didn't think to give her address.
